                <h2 id="introduction-to-flexbox">Introduction to Flexbox</h2>
                <p>The Flexible Box, or as it is commonly called flexbox, was added to CSS3 as an alternative to the
                    classical block model. Flexbox was created to provide predictive behavior of page elements for
                    different screen sizes and different display devices of the displayed page. Since it doesn’t use
                    floats and its margins don’t collapse with the contents’ margins, flexbox often provides a much
                    simpler model over the standard block model.
                    Many designers will find the flexbox model easier to use. Child elements in a flexbox can be laid
                    out in any direction and can have flexible dimensions to adapt to the display space. Positioning
                    child elements is thus much easier, and complex layouts can be achieved more simply and with cleaner
                    code, as the display order of the elements is independent of their order in the source code. This
                    independence intentionally affects only the visual rendering, leaving speech order and navigation
                    based on the source order.</p>
                <h2 id="what-we-ll-build">What we'll build</h2>
                <p>Today we’ll see a cool technique for creating a web layout with fixed header and footer. The height
                    of the header and footer adjusts to their inner content, and the middle section takes the rest of
                    the screen, showing a scrollbar if its content needs more height.</p>
                <p>For example, our layout can be used to keep the page’s name, menu or breadcrumbs always visible on
                    the header, and Save/Cancel buttons on the footer.</p>
                <p>I’ve seen this layout implemented with a fixed position and set heights for the header and footer.
                    The problems with this approach start when the height of either the header or the footer change, for
                    example because of dynamic data, or different screen resolutions. Since the approach hard-codes the
                    height, it doesn’t adapt dynamically to the content it holds.</p>

                <h2 id="flexbox-to-the-rescue-">Flexbox to the rescue!</h2>
                <p>Luckily for us, there’s a much simpler approach that solves the problem, using Flexbox, and works in
                    all major browsers. The basic concept is to make the header, middle and footer sections use a
                    flexbox layout. The height of the header and footer sections will adjust automatically to their
                    content, as is the standard behavior for any div.
                    We first set the wrapper for the 3 sections to display using flexbox, taking the full height of the
                    viewport:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.sections-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    height: 100vh;
}</code></pre>
                <p>When the content of the middle section doesn’t fill the remaining space, we’d like to make sure that
                    the middle section expands while the header and footer stay at the size of their content. We
                    therefore set their flex-grow to 0:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.section-top, .panel-bottom {
    flex-shrink: 0;
}</code></pre>
                <p>When the content of the middle section overflow the remaining space, we’d like to make sure that the
                    header and footer keep their size, and the middle section shows a vertical scrollbar. To do this, we
                    set the flex-shrink of the header and footer to 0:</p>
                <h2 id="adding-a-shadow-to-indicate-additional-content">Adding a shadow to indicate additional
                    content</h2>
                <p>Let’s now add a bit of shadow, to visually indicate when there’s more content available above/below
                    what’s currently displayed on screen.
                    We create a combination of a linear gradient and radial gradient for the shadow effect. We make sure
                    it doesn’t repeat so it is shown only on the top and/or bottom sides of the middle section.
                    We also set the shadow to start 40 pixels from each side, so there’s no shadow when the user reaches
                    to top/bottom of the middle section.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.section-middle {
    overflow: overlay;
    overflow-x: hidden;
    background: linear-gradient(#fff 30%, rgba(255,255,255,0)),linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,0), #fff 70%) 0 100%,radial-gradient(farthest-side at 50% 0, rgba(43,43,43,0.25),rgba(43,43,43,0)),radial-gradient(farthest-side at 50% 100%, rgba(43,43,43,0.2),rgba(43,43,43,0)) 0 100%;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-color: white;
    background-size: 100% 40px, 100% 40px, 100% 14px, 100% 14px;
    background-attachment: local, local, scroll, scroll;
}</code></pre>
                <h2 id="styling-the-scrollbar">Styling the Scrollbar</h2>
                <p>In Chrome, we can also style the vertical scrollbar. Let’s change the styling a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.section-middle::-webkit-scrollbar
{
     width: 4px;
     background: rgb(243,243,243);
}

.section-middle::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb
{
    background: rgb(150,150,150);
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <div class="section-bottom">
                <h2>That’s all folks!</h2>
                <p>
                    As we’ve just seen, flexbox can sometimes magically give elegant solutions to complex problems. Here's
                    our final solution again, and a Plunker for your convenience.
